### Hello there ‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hey there! I have 7+ years of web and software development experience and a background in graphic and web design. I enjoy crafting high-quality user experiences and collaborating with others to solve difficult challenges. I'm passionate about human-friendly technology that respects privacy and empowers people. 

Over the years I've worked my way further down the stack, working with tech like TypeScript, React, GraphQL and Node. I've dabbled in other languages and frameworks but web has always been my passion. Currently interested in Jamstack architecture and technology with a great developer experience, like Next.js, Tailwind.css, Chakra UI and React Query.
