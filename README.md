### Hello there ‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My name is Seth Daniel McLeod

I was born on January 1st, 1995 at 10:26pm in Wilmington, North Carolina

Over the years I've had many titles: **Software Engineer**, **Designer**, **Mentor**, **Tech Generalist**... but those are just labels for roles I've played. If you're curious about _who I am_ then look up my [Natal Chart](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=natal+chart) _(spoiler alert: it's Capricorn)_

I've been building software for 7+ years and have a background in design. I enjoy crafting quality experiences and collaborating with others to solve challenges. I'm passionate about human-friendly technology that respects privacy and encourages service to others.
